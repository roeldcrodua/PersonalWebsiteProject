# Portfolio Project: Your Portfolio Website
This is a final project milestone for the course FSE 294: Intro to Web Design - Arizona State University

## Your Task
Let’s get started! For this part of your Portfolio Project, you’ll be focused on completing the Navbar, Hero, and Footer sections of your portfolio.

## Requirements

### Add Bootstrap Library to the HTML
- Start by adding the Bootstrap CDN links from Bootstrap's website to your HTML. 

### Create the Hero Section
- Remember, we call this the “hero” section because it includes a “hero image”, which is just tech lingo for a large banner image that is prominently placed, and typically takes up the full width of the webpage.
- Should have a large background image that spans 100% of the page’s width.
- Should include a centered, circular headshot image with a border.
- Should include a centered h1 tag with your name.
- Should include a centered tagline.
- All elements in the hero section (including the headshot image) should be sized responsively across different screen resolutions.
- All text should be readable against the background image.

### Create the Navbar
- Should contain links that successfully navigate to the different sections of the page: Mission, Skills, and Contact.
- Should be fixed to the top of the page.
- Should collapse with a “hamburger” button at small screen resolutions.
- Should use an image or icon for the Navbar’s “Brand”.

### Create the Footer
- Text content should contain a copyright symbol.
- Text content should be horizontally centered.
- Text content should be vertically centered.

### Create the Mission Section
- Should contain a centered heading. 
- Should contain an image.
- Should contain a paragraph of text.
- Image and text should be displayed in two columns on medium screen sizes and above.
- Image and text should be displayed as two separate rows on small screen sizes. 

### Create the Skills Section
- Should contain a centered heading.
- Should include 4 skills. (Note that HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are all available to you now as skills!)
- Each skill should have an image with some text underneath.
- Skills should be displayed as four columns (one row) on large-sized screens, two columns (two rows) on medium-sized screens, and a single column (four rows) on smaller screens.

### Create the Contact Section
- Should contain a centered heading.
- Should contain three or more social icons.
- Icons should be displayed as three columns on medium screen sizes and above and collapse into rows at small screen sizes.
- Icons should change color on mouse hover.

### LevelUp (Optional) Add a Bootstrap Carousel 
- Should contain a centered heading.
- Should contain a Bootstrap carousel component with at least three items.
- The carousel should have indicators, controls, and captions.
- Each carousel item should have a uniform size and width.
